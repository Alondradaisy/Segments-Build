# Build 01: Segment Schema

## Concept: Build a mental structure --Segment Schema -- that encourages strengthening of neural networks in response to internal and external stimuli. Mental structures serve as a framework that enables humans to create meaningful experiences from stimulus received. The Segment Schema is the base layer of this container that aims to embody growing, learning, building and playing.

### Grow | Learn | **Build** | Play
**Build** is a framework comprised of metrics to guide multi-applicable 4 week builds. It's a systematic way to integrate and implement while firing those neural networks.

_The brain is like a muscle, where continuous integration is key for maintaining activity. Block by block, spark neural pathways by lighting up to retrieve, to produce, to update frequently -- to build._

Systems are important because they bind us to the importance of structure. They shape the way we connect with ourself and others. As mental structures, they influence the values we align with and those we deny. As social structures, they provide a network of support. There are several types of structures already in place, plenty of practices that are heavily supported and everything in between. Segment Schema is simply another structure being developed to share from a deeper layer.

As human beings, we are in constant cycles of receiving and retrieving, filtering through and updating as we move through life. We all have the capacity to harness the power to shape our lives as we want in response to how we assign meaning to stimuli.

As human, we are constantly living in cycles:
1) receiving input
2) interpreting and filtering through
3) assigning meaning to experiences in direct response to what aligns with our internal beliefs

Let's compare the human brain neural network to neural networks in AI with the image below. [Deep Learning](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2018/10/01/what-is-deep-learning-ai-a-simple-guide-with-8-practical-examples/?sh=75daee8f8d4b) is a type of AI that imitates the way humans learn by creating artificial algorithmic networks for machines to learn from -- machine learning (ML). Just as Deep Learning neural models are made of an interconnected web of nodes that need data to process and recognize correlations, the human brain is made of complex neural networks of neurons that work together to help humans process information. It is through the schema that data passed through is clustered and classified. Data is the only experience for neural networks. 

So with this in mind, if you have an idea of improvements you want to adopt in your life — perhaps how you want to influence your actions, engagements, thoughts, and patterns — consider adapting to a mental structure that aligns with your values. As you move through life, the layers of experiences will be filtered through the schema, therefore optimizing brain power and decision-making. Our ability to rewire our brain comes from the input we give it daily. Create the habit of rewiring the wires that fire by allowing yourself to adapt.

_Thoughts become attitudes, attitudes shape actions, actions mold into behavior and behaviors should match words, so live accordingly._

The Segment Schema is meant to be a skeleton that encourages the power to create and strengthen neuroplasticity through a structured lens. Think of it as a framework to grow through life, not just float through life. Over the last month, I’ve shared weekly metrics that have helped me document and bring Segment Schema to life outside of Instagram.

Did you miss the introduction to [Segments](https://medium.com/@daisydocuments/segments-grow-learn-build-play-7d62ecbdb4fd)? Click there or [click here](https://medium.com/@daisydocuments/segments-grow-learn-build-play-7d62ecbdb4fd). Over the last year, I've been slowly piecing together a system to gear me into disrupting the patterns doing me disservice and usher myself into a more structured way to engage. Segments Schema is the foundation to all else that is coming in this container. 

_4 components that weave 3 principles, compared in 2 ways for 1 mind -- anyone's mind._

Also, if you are interesting in learning more behind the science of neuroplasticity and all things neuroscience, I 10/10 recommend listening to the [Huberman Lab Podcast](https://hubermanlab.com/) by [Andrew Huberman](https://hubermanlab.com/about/) where he focuses on sharing a wealth of in-depth studies backed by science. He created a ["Neuroplasticity Super-Protocol"](https://hubermanlab.com/teach-and-learn-better-with-a-neuroplasticity-super-protocol/) that aims to target actionable behavioral tools to incorporate into daily life. I find myself visiting his podcast on Spotify every week and enjoy reading his monthly newsletters. Learn more [here](https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network/)!

_As an ongoing practice of learning and sharing to nourish neuroplasticity, I am very much open to listening and engaging with other trains of thought or mental structures. Cheers!
