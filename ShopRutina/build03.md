# Build 03: Shop Rutina 

## A 3-part dive into a simple e-commerce shop built in React. 

Build 03 as a concept was what prompted me to create Segments. If I'm being frank, being in a building and designing environment led me to introduce Segments, and more specifically, the Build Segment. As you may remember from my [Segments Intro](https://github.com/Alondradaisy/Segments), Build is one of the four Segments I have enjoyed sharing as a way to maintain an active brain. 

_**Building**_ | _The brain is like a muscle, where continuous integration is key for maintaining activity. Block by block, spark neural pathways by lighting up to retrieve, to produce, to update frequently -- to build._

Shop Rutina was a concept e-commerce store that I built from scratch to play around and explore with. For Build 03, I divided the breakdown into 3 parts.

[Part 1: Feature Breakdown](https://javascript.plainenglish.io/shop-rutina-front-end-dive-65cd9a47b00d)

[Part 2: Product Model Build](https://javascript.plainenglish.io/shop-rutina-front-end-dive-d030912af9f3)

[Part 3: AWS S3 Data Hosting](https://aws.plainenglish.io/shop-rutina-front-end-dive-3f66ec31d57d)

Each part is dedicated to its own section of the front-end with maps, source code, design processes, links and resources. Feel free to click on the link the link to Part 1, Part 2, and Part 3 to view the front-end through itemized processes.

Back in 2022, I introduced [Segments: Grow | Learn | Build | Play](https://medium.com/@daisydocuments/segments-grow-learn-build-play-7d62ecbdb4fd) as a vehicle to find more fulfillment in the way I engage and share deeper parts of myself through an intentional lens. It has now become a practice that I have enjoyed navigating and [documenting](https://medium.com/@daisydocuments/segments-documentation-f450e1471465) in the process. It's a structured method of sharing around growing, learning, building and playing to nourish neuroplasticity. 

_As an ongoing practice of learning and sharing to nourish neuroplasticity, I am very much open to listening and engaging with other trains of thought or mental structures. Cheers!_
