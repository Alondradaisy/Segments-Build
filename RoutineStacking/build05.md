# Routine Stacking

## A system-based approach to managing outcomes.

The compound effect of Routine Stacking speaks to the systems thinker more than the goal setter. Why? Consider the difference between the two.

Consistency and accountability through routine have been a driving force throughout my best years of life _thus far_. Maintaining a rhythm (regardless of redirection) has been the foundation of my personal wins, while moments, where I have fallen off the wagon, have proven otherwise. The encompassing theme I‚Äôve noticed in myself (and observing others in their own worlds) is that the systems we create for ourselves establish and strengthen the structure of life.

Build 05: Routine Stacking is bringing me back to [Build 01: Segment Schema](https://github.com/Alondradaisy/Segments-Build/tree/master/SegmentSchema). In that piece, I introduced Segments, made the connection between two distinct neural networks, and compared them to illuminate their similarities.

_‚ÄúJust as Deep Learning neural models are made of an interconnected web of nodes that need data to process and recognize correlations, the human brain is made of a complex neural network of neurons that work together to help humans process information.‚Äù_

From Build 01:

- _As human beings, we are in constant cycles of receiving and retrieving, filtering through and updating as we move through life. We all have the capacity to harness the power to shape our lives as we want in response to how we assign meaning to stimuli._

Thoughts and words can be so powerful. Words are words on their own, but put them together and you‚Äôre able to paint a picture. [Healthline.com](https://www.healthline.com/health/how-many-thoughts-per-day#thoughts-per-day) published a [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-17255-9) that showed the number of thoughts that can float in and out of our minds through brain scans.

_‚ÄúThe results of a 2020 study suggested that people typically have more than 6,000 thoughts per day.‚Äù_

The more emphasis we place on assigning meaning to those thoughts, the more we can realize how powerful thoughts really are. This could mean pausing to think about the thought, writing it down and/or about it, having a conversation about it, acting on it, etc. A belief that has followed me from childhood into adulthood is that we can always adapt, change, improve and/or remove elements from our routine(s) by _simply_ deciding.

Once we make a committed decision, we‚Äôll naturally find ways to match our actions with said decision. ‚ÄúYou can write your own story‚Äù as highlighted in [Don Miguel Ruiz‚Äôs](https://www.miguelruiz.com/) Voice of Knowledge book. Sounds clich√©, but **believing that you can is a power move**.

Throughout life, we change to support lifestyles and models we perceive to be reachable. Change tends to be incremental, more often than drastic, which leads from a systems approach. While we may know people who have quit a habit cold turkey, it‚Äôs more sustainable to approach changes in behavior though small consistent steps. Working with systems to create behavioral changes:

1. encourages consistent follow through
2. promotes a more achievable result
3. creates enough stress to take action

You may be thinking, _‚ÄúWhy would I want to create stress as I‚Äôm trying to change or create new habits?‚Äù_ Fair. You may be thinking about the uneasy, overwhelming feelings associated with leaving behind habitual behaviors that no longer serve your new frame of mind. However, the word stress is an umbrella term. Though we generally connect stress with a negative connotation, there‚Äôs also positive stress.

Eustress = challenging, but manageable experiences that feel rewarding

Distress = uneasy and overwhelming experiences that feel unmanageable

Eustress is associated with positive stress that creates motivation to take action. Distress is associated with the negative stress that is a result of perceived difficulty. _Can you think of times where you‚Äôve experienced both types of stress? What feelings dominated each type of stress? Were they influential to take action or a cause for a lack of thereof?_

Recently, I listened to an episode of [The Drive Podcast](https://open.spotify.com/show/63AWQmsSnFNFHUqnRAOFtD?si=1ed93cdf98fb4cd5&nd=1) where [Dr. Peter Attia](https://peterattiamd.com/) had a conversation with the author of [Atomic Habits](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits), [James Clear](https://jamesclear.com/) that dissected key components of human behavior. In episode [#183: Building & changing habits](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4DDvoQHxG1ui0H4N1GNBjJ?si=3a614d814a434354&nd=1), Attia asks Clear how he came up with the title of the book to which he responds with,

_‚ÄúEach little habit is like an atom in the overall routine of your day. You put them altogether and you end up with your lifestyle.‚Äù_

Think of the habits and practices that are contribute to your day-to-day routine. Likely, there are things you do that are nearly second nature, some non-negotiables, some things you‚Äôre trying to incorporate in, and perhaps other things that are distractions.

Perhaps at some point in this year you‚Äôve taken inventory of your habits and practices. Have you adopted a new habit (or thought about it), strengthened a certain ability, or assessed where you‚Äôre directing your attention? Perhaps, you‚Äôre content with who you are and don‚Äôt care to continue growing and shaping your mind and body. These questions are not for me to answer, but more to encourage trains of thought.

Routine Stacking is about building upon current habits. This way, it doesn‚Äôt feel so daunting to introduce new ways of thinking and operating out of thin air.

**One way to do this is to add small things to your current routine.**

‚û° Want to put more energy into reading books? Place the book next to your phone on your nightstand. Frame it for yourself as: After I decompress from the day and eat dinner, I will read 10 pages from a book.

‚û° Want to workout in the morning instead of the evening? Prep and place your workout gear next to your bedroom door. Frame it for yourself as: After I drink my morning coffee, I will knockout a workout.

_Atomic Habits_ highlights 4 Laws of Behavior Change

Make it obvious
1. Make it attractive

2. Make it easy

3. Make it satisfying

To iterate on the examples above:

‚û° Want to put more energy into reading books?
1. Make it obvious: Place the book by your nightstand.
2. Make it attractive: Frame it for yourself.
3. Make it easy: Commit to only reading a few pages.
4. Make it satisfying: What is the reinforcing behavior?

‚û° Want to workout in the morning instead of the evening?
1. Make it obvious: Place your workout clothes somewhere you‚Äôll see them in the morning.
2. Make it attractive: Frame it for yourself.
3. Make it easy: Do it right after you‚Äôve finished a current habit (morning coffee).
4. Make it satisfying: Follow it up with a delicious protein filled breakfast.

[Huberman Lab podcast](https://open.spotify.com/show/79CkJF3UJTHFV8Dse3Oy0P?si=d2d7795c8a604124&nd=1) recently released an episode that dove into using caffeine to enhance our mental and physical performance. Take a listen: [Using Caffeine to Optimize Mental & Physical Performance | Episode 101](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5UXYDLF6e66k8K9X6VwZB5?si=6d540dcb9c884635&nd=1). It spotlighted an interesting science-backed take on how caffeine consumption can actually trick the brain into liking things (reinforcing behavior) through its interaction with our dopamine receptors.

Keep at it consistently and you‚Äôll see how you‚Äôll naturally get in the habit of doing those things. The key to rewiring our brain is to repeat behavior over and over again until it becomes normal, until it becomes a regular tendency. We can always improve our abilities; we just need to decide.

**Another method to use in habit stacking is reverse engineering.**

In computer programming, many times we know how a program should run/function. When we know what its functionality should do, we plug in the steps to make the function do ‚Äòx‚Äô. You can comment your code by action or by line to classify its role in the function or simply write the function and move on.

_// Generally in development, it‚Äôs good practice to comment your code as it helps other programmers get a clear gist of what you produced. Comments in code usually look like this._

Essentially you‚Äôre starting from the end, and working backwards to the final product.

Where do you want to end up?
What are the steps to get there?
Where are you currently?
This is where we see how goals are important, but the systems we follow are essential. Systems are a measure that get managed. Without managing our goals, the outcomes aren‚Äôt as optimal as they could be. Without an execution plan, ideas are just floating thoughts. Simply thinking and claiming isn‚Äôt enough. Take action, repeat the system and form will follow. To rewire our brains, we need actionable steps to follow and repetition to cement new neural connections.

As an ongoing practice of learning and sharing to nourish neuroplasticity, I am very much open into engaging with other trains of thought or mental structures. Cheers!
