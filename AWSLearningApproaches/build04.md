# AWS Learning Approaches

## A resource-based guide to encourage learning (AWS focused). 

When I introduced [Segments: Grow | Learn | Build | Play](https://medium.com/create-rutina/segments-grow-learn-build-play-7d62ecbdb4fd), it came from a very personal place: to maintain personal accountability and to create structure around how I engage with interests. On the other side of the coin, it's also very much about encouraging the learning aspect of personal growth through intentional sharing.

Scarcity of informational content is nearly non-existent with the mass shift to using media as an educational platform. Motivation is what is scarce these days. Want to dive into a curiosity? Define and ask questions about it. Want to communicate better? Read a negotiation book. Want to scale a business? Seek a mentor who’s a few steps ahead of your position. Information is out there — seek and you shall find.

_**"When we open ourselves up to learning, we really open ourselves up to rewiring ourselves, and this is what this whole Segments series is about."**_

**With that said, let’s get started with AWS Learning Approaches.**

The beginning of October marked the opening of [AWS re:Invent 2022](https://portal.awsevents.com/events/reInvent2022/registration) registration, AWS’ global cloud computing conference that is hosted over the span of one week in Las Vegas and virtually online from Monday November 28, 2022 to Friday December 2, 2022. Reserving a virtual seat (FREE) grants you access to a wealth of information and engagement including (but not limited to):

- live re:Invent sessions
- community builders
- keynote presentations
- hero sessions
- guides

In this piece, I will be sharing resources and tools that I’ve found, explored, and used centered around diving into AWS Cloud Computing. These are references, reminders, and bookmarks I’ve gathered and placed in my toolkit that have influenced my own learning experience. Take into account that this is simply an approach, meaning, you can input your own interests.

💡

**Contextualize Concepts**
As a starter point for this piece, I defined six mediums of resource-based learning tools that I wanted to refer to. The way that I chose to go about breaking each tool was by mapping out the mediums use to engage my learning muscle. This meant thinking about the ways that have helped me absorb new information more organically.

Back in 2022, I shared [Link Loop](https://medium.com/@daisydocuments/build-link-loop-999313d979c1) which was created as a mind map guided by metrics to define and practice what’s most important through creating actionable routes to encourage routine. I decided to incorporate this sort style to visualize and ideate.

### Framework Application
Having the brain power to acknowledge and apply systems thinking to our work is what makes building a smoother, more efficient road. The Oxford Dictionary defines a system as “a set of principles or procedures according to which something is done”. Systems manage internal functional performance in technology as routines support stress management in humans.

This framework creates a deeper understanding of what ‘well-architected’ building systems in the cloud should operate on. According to [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/welcome.html), “It provides a way for you to consistently measure your architectures against best practices and identify areas for improvement.”

#### The 6 pillars of the AWS Well-Architected Framework & Best Practices

**Operational Excellence:** 

To build, maintain and support specific workload requirements unique to each business and operational metrics
   
  🎯 Organize
  🎯 Prepare
  🎯 Operate
  🎯 Evolve

**Security:**

To protect and/or respond to identity and access management data risks through defined compliance features

🎯 Security
🎯 Identity and Access Management (IAM)
🎯 Detection
🎯 Infrastructure Protection
🎯 Data Protection
🎯 Incident Response

**Reliability:**

To provide a reliable architecture that handles workload requests and avoids failures

🎯 Foundations
🎯 Workload Architecture 
🎯 Change Management
🎯 Failure Management

**Performance Efficiency:**

To maintain high-level performance architecture across systems as they scale

🎯 Selection
🎯 Review
🎯 Monitoring
🎯 Tradeoffs

**Cost Optimization:**
To consider the economic benefits of cost-effective resources and terminate the idea of up-front costs

🎯 Practice Cloud Financial Management
🎯 Expenditure and usage awareness
🎯 Cost-effective resources
🎯 Manage demand and supply resources
🎯 Optimize over time

**Sustainability:**
To manage efficiency across workloads to maximize benefits on all resources

🎯 Region selection
🎯 User behavior patterns
🎯 Software and architecture patterns
🎯 Data patterns
🎯 Hardware patterns
🎯 Development and deployment patterns

As AWS states, _"Creating a software system is a lot like constructing a building. If the foundation is not solid, structural problems can undermine the integrity and function of the building."_

Overall, this is not an exhaustive list of tools, but it is meant to be an approachable resource to reach your fingertips to the ☁️ AWS cloud. Learning should be stimulating and a part of our everyday lives in some capacity. If you find yourself curious, but don’t know where to start, I’ve laid out 6 mediums to explore and direct links to each person + blog mentioned. See you in the cloud!

💡

Back in June, I introduced [Segments: Grow | Learn | Build | Play](https://medium.com/create-rutina/segments-grow-learn-build-play-7d62ecbdb4fd) as a vehicle to find more fulfillment in the way I engage and share deeper parts of myself through an intentional lens. It has now become a practice that I have enjoyed navigating and documenting in the process. It’s a structured method of sharing around growing, learning, building and playing to nourish neuroplasticity.

_As an ongoing practice of learning and sharing to nourish neuroplasticity, I am very much open into engaging with other trains of thought or mental structures. Cheers!_
